When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
I would do that when I work with other developers or just for safety in case I lost my laptop.
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I may not want to systematically include all changes made by other developers on the 
remote repo in my local repo.
    

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Fork : clone one repository from a github account to another github account.
clone : copy a repository from a remote or local location to a location directory.
branch : create a subset of changes into an existing repository.

    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
This would help to do merge without too much complications.
    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Easier : no learning curve, just rules set by the team and myself.
Harder : managing versions, identifying and resolving conflicts.
    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
